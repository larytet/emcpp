Question 4: Which of the following statements correctly describe the code below in  C ++?  #define language 437 // Line 1 #if language <400  #undef language // Line 2 #else // Line 3 #define language 850 // Line 4 #ifdef language // Line 5    printf ("% d", language); // Line 6 #endif #endif A.

C.  int main () {      cout << ExDer1 :: GetStat () << endl; }  will result in an ambiguity error from the compiler.  D.  class ExDer1: public ExBase {  public:     friend int Der1Fn () {return ExBase :: stat;} };  will result in an access error from the compiler.

Question 10: Given the following program snippet, what can we conclude about the  use of dynamic_cast in C ++?   #include <iostream> #include <memory>  

// Someone else's code, eg library class IGlyph {  public:      virtual ~ IGlyph () {}      virtual std :: string Text () = 0;     virtual IIcon * Icon () = 0;     // ... };   class IWidgetSelector {  public:      virtual ~ IWidgetSelector () {}           virtual void AddItem (IGlyph *) = 0;     virtual IGlyph * Selection () = 0; };    // Your code  class MyItem: public IGlyph {  public:      virtual std :: string Text ()     {          return this-> text;     }       virtual IIcon * Icon ()     {          return this-> icon.get ();     }           void Activate ()     {          std :: cout << "My Item Activated" << std :: endl;     }           std :: string text;     std :: auto_ptr <IIcon> icon; };   void SpiffyForm :: OnDoubleClick (IWidgetSelector * ws) {      IGlyph * gylph = ws-> Selection ();      MyItem * item = dynamic_cast <MyItem *> (gylph);     if (item)          item-> Activate ();}
A.  The dynamic_cast ought to be a reinterpret_cast since the concrete type is unknown.   B.  The dynamic_cast is unnecessary since we know that the concrete type returned by IWidgetSelector :: Selection () must be a MyItem object.   C.  The dynamic_cast is redundant, the programmer can invoke Activate directly, eg ws-> Selection () -> Activate ();   D.  The dynamic_cast is necessary since we can not know for certain what concrete type is returned by IWidgetSelector :: Selection ().   E.  A polymorphic_cast should be used in place of the dynamic_cast.

uestion 18: In the given C ++ code snippet, which of the following statements correctly  identify how Mon of enum DOW can be assigned to a variable named var?   void main () 
{     const int Mon = 1, Tue = 2;     enum DOW {Mon = 11, Tue = 12};    ...    A.  The variable var will have to be of type enum DOW, and then defined as:   var = Mon;  B.  Mon of enum DOW can not be assigned because the compiler will give a redefinition error.   C.  Since enum DOW has been declared and defined later, it will be pushed onto the stack later, but will be accessed first. Hence, the scope resolution operator is not required and var will be assigned as:    var = Mon;  D.  Since Mon is of type enum DOW, var will be assigned as:   var = DOW :: Mon;  E.

Question 48: In C ++, which of the following statements accurately describe a base  class destructor calling a virtual function override of a derived class?    A.  The base class destructor calls the virtual function override of the derived class through the vtable.   B.  The base class destructor can not call the virtual function override of the derived class because the derived class portion of the data may be in an undefined state.   C.  The base class destructor calls the virtual function of the base class and not of the derived class.   D.  The C ++ compiler maintains the overridden virtual function pointers in a separate structure when it sees the call in a destructor. The call is then resolved through this structure.   E.  The language does not permit calling a virtual function override in either a constructor or the destructor of the base class.

The number of bytes to read can be specified to the getline () function, whereas it can not be done with the extraction operator.     B. Delimiters indicating end of input can be specified to the getline () function, whereas the extraction operator has no such facility.     C. The getline () function by default, accepts whitespace, and returns on seeing the \ n character, whereas the extraction operator returns when encounters any whitespace character.     D. The getline () function can be overloaded to accept different argument types, whereas the extraction operator can not be overloaded.     E.

Question 22: In the given C ++ code snippet, which of the following statements correctly  identify how Mon of enum DOW can be assigned to a variable named var?   void main () {     const int Mon = 1, Tue = 2;     enum DOW {Mon = 11, Tue = 12};    ...    A. Mon of enum DOW can not be assigned because the compiler will give a redefinition error.     B. The variable var will have to be of type enum DOW, and then defined as:   var = Mon;     C. Since Mon is of type enum DOW, var will be assigned as:   var = DOW :: Mon;     D. Since enum DOW has been declared and defined later, it will be pushed onto the stack later, but will be accessed first. Hence, the scope resolution operator is not required and var will be assigned as:    var = Mon;     E. The variable var must be of type const int, and then it can be assigned as:   var = static_cast <const int> (Mon);

A destructor may be invoked as a result of stack unwinding while an exception It is being handled.     C. It can invoke the terminate () handler.     D. Since the object is being destroyed, it is illogical to throw an exception then.    E. A destructor in C ++ can not implement a try ... catch block.
